<small>FYI: I use Markdown and AI auto-complete to help me write "faster" documentation.</small>

Despite this, the bullet points I put everywhere is just my natural preference after many years of using Markdown for notes and documentation. It is a way to deal with the "trailing space" that I always forget. 😅
While GenAI usually adds a lot of bullets everywhere, they, recognized the pattern that many do this for years.

The primary goals of this project are to:
- showcase how to extract cost information from Azure Subscriptions
  - consolidated view
  - make an open-source dashboard to support that
- This is supposed to be simple and offer a high-level view of costs
