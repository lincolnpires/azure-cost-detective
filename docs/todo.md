## Epics overview
============
- Foundational setup + Deployment
  - The goal is to have the basic Azure infra deployable and a basic "App Shell".
  - If a user can fully deploy a non-functional app to their own Azure, that is a win.
- User Authentication + UI
  - The goal is to have users authenticate against Azure/Entra ID and have a basic UI to interact with.
  - Lorem ipsum data would be fine.
- Cost Data Extraction + Display
  - The goal is to implement core logic. 
  - Fetch cost data from selected subscriptions and display it in the UI.
  - Basic aggregated cost display and top 5 costly resources.
  - Meaning: this is a fully functional MVP. Users can see real cost data.
